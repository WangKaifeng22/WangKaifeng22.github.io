I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring Electronic Information Science and Technology in [OUC](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/). And I've been admitted to [BUAA](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) for a master's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering through the recommendation system in China.  
My research interest currently lies in computational imaging, deep learning and signal processing. Recently, I'm doing research about USCT(Ultrasound computed tomography) method based on deep learning.
